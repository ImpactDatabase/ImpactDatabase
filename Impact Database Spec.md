# 'Impact Database' - Project Outline

- *In plain language.*

## ðŸ’¡The 'Big Idea'

Impact investing is a field that aims to bring radical new thinking that touches upon a few fields:

- Development finance 
- Social finance 
- Climate finance
- The investment industry 

Some of these approaches pose big questions that could radically alter the way in which government and businesses operate:

- What if instead of paying for social services, governments paid only for specific defined outcomes ('pay for success, pay for outcomes')?
- If we could create the right set of incentives, could governments and private investors pool their resources to achieve more good (social impact bonds and variants)?
- We want to lend money to businesses and governments that act sustainably. What if we could agree upon a system that linked the rate of borrowing to the achievement of independently audited objectives (sustainability-linked bonds, sustainability-linked loans)?
- What if we could find a way to calculate businesses' impacts on societies and the planet and express them in monetary terms - like financial line items (impact-weighted accounting)?

To test how well these ideas work, and encourage adoption, the generation and analysis of data is critical.

## The Little Idea (This One)

The **'Impact Database'** will be a data publishing portal that aggregates and presents datasets that are of interest to the impact investing community. It might also publish analysis based upon those datasets. 

### Website features (planned):

- **Data publication:** Publishing (with permission) datasets of interest published by third parties. Adding categorisation and tagging for easy navigation. 







**URL:** Redacted while in staging and under development.

## Project Roadmap
